To be honest our debute PAN is a stressful record.\
It's density makes listening to it quite a ride.\
High ambitions, sophistication, the feeling we need to keep it a bit ruff and underground led to 17 Tunes that couldn't have come out of us any other way.\
Sola Plexus was a duo back then. Zizerator, my friend and collaborator on Sola Plexus and this first record, who released it on his imprint Z-Muzic, is still part of the whole Sola Plexus process. PAN is a reminder and lecture I don't wanna miss. It has splendid lyrics I still love and admire and riddims that laid the foundation for the Sola Plexus Vibe. I still got one box of CDs left, so if you dig it, cop it. There won't be any reissues ever.
