This record is the first of many and feels like a reset after a long period of time contemplating who I am and what I want without releasing any relevant music. It's meant for everyone that has love for HipHop, UK Rave Music and the MC culture. It's for my people. My fellow Indians, the MCs, the junglists, the ravers, the DJs, the producers, all vocalists, the nerds, the underdogs, but especially for my family and friends. I tell you: I am one of you and you are not alone. You are part of me like I am part of you.
